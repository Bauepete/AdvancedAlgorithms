## Overview
### General Goal
Prepare students to qualify for the Austrian IOI.


A course planned from school year 2016/17 onwards motivating interested students to take part in programming competitions and introducing basic concepts and patterns like

- Complete search
- Greedy algorithm
- Dynamic programming

## Program

skdjflasd

- IOI Assignments: general structure; warm-up
- Trees ???
- Recursion
- Greedy Algorithm
- Complete Search
- Dynamic Programming


## Todos

- Check examples
- Classify examples along problem solving strategies
- Play through I/O scenario along the first example presented by Flo


## General Format

1. Present a problem solving strategy
2. Present a problem and ensure that everybody understood the problem
3. Let students find a solution to the problem on sheet and pencil
4. Students to present this solution to us
5. Then implementation is allowed

## Schedule
- Info Event: September 19 und September 26
