# AdvancedAlgorithms
## Overview
### General Information
The course IF.99.1 "Advanced Algorithms" is one of the courses offered under the HTL Leonding *Program Of Excellence*. It aims to prepare students to qualify for the Austrian Olympiad in Informatics. Ideally we get one or more of our students qualified for the International Olympiad in Informatics.

### Topics
A course planned from school year 2016/17 onwards motivating interested students to take part in programming competitions and introducing basic concepts and patterns like

- Complete search
- Greedy algorithm
- Dynamic programming

## Program

- IOI Assignments: general structure; warm-up
- Recursion
- Greedy Algorithm
- Complete Search
- Dynamic Programming
- Trees ???

## General Format
1. Present a problem solving strategy
2. Present a problem and ensure that everybody understood the problem
3. Let students find a solution to the problem on sheet and pencil
4. Students to present this solution to us
5. Then ONLY implementation will start

## General Schedule
### Info Event
Within the first two weeks of the winter term an information event is done for all second graders. One of the last year's IOI contestants is presenting the highlights.

In this meeting we additionally give some administrational information concerning the course (when to start, possible options for a regular meeting time, etc.) Interested students can apply for the course and give their preferred meeting times.

### Meeting Structure
The first meeting is normally held about two weeks after the Info Event. Typically it will take place around end of September or beginning of October.

From this date onwards we will meet every two weeks.

## Todos
- Check examples
- Classify examples along problem solving strategies
- Play through I/O scenario along the first example presented by Flo
